# Ops compilation

## Introduction

This is my devops/infrastructure stack-and-module compilation that is easy to set-up for multiple projects from MVPs to large-scale types.

## Tech stacks:

- Terraform
- Serverless framework (AWS cloudformation)
- Ansible
- Docker & Docker swarm
- Scripting languages (Python, NodeJS, Bash,...)
- CI frameworks (Github actions, CircleCI,...)

## Notes:

If you guys want to contribute, please open a PR from the master branch, I'll review it if possible :grinning:, though I'm quite busy.

Also, any suggestions are welcome by opening new issues in Github, I'll try to discuss on the feature/bug-fixes or answering the questions from you guys.

Thanks again for noticing. Please leave a star if you find this repo useful.
